        <h1> Introduction</h1>
        <p> 
            Hello, I'm Fuma Suenaga, a computer science student of Osaka Univ.
            I'm learning a lot of thing including computer science(ex: philosophy, physics, applied math).
            I wish this site would help you study more excitingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Warning: I am native to Japan, so first, I write sentences in Japanese.
            However, I translated them to English later.
        </p> 

        <h1> Welcome to my ego! </h1>
        <h2> How to Study?</h2>
        <h3> My study is BFS!</h3>
        <p> 
            I figured it out that I have learned like BFS search, which means a search algorithm
            against tree structure. I studied math, english, philosophy, phisics, and others but
            no one is complete until I continue to learning. I am learning multiple fields concurrently.
            The other idea opposed to BFS is DFS,
            which means "study until it is complete". 
            This type of students look smarter than BFS-type, but don't worry.
            Both DFS and BFS is the same computation complexity, which is O(W).
            Time solve the difference so dont forget continuing to learn!
            
        <h3> How to speed up your study</h3>
        </p>
            There are many ways of how to study efficiently, effortlessly.
            However, Don't expect me to say these apparently easy ways.
            No shortcut for studying exists, but you can run fast, or sometimes walk with your freinds,
            teachers. I'll give you such ways, and those when you are blocked to obstacles.
        <h4> What do we study? Is that truely unknown?</h4>
        <p>
            First, I'll give my ego. It depens on you whether you believe or not.
            My ego is ...
            <b>
                Everything consists of something you've already known. 
            </b>
            So you want to ask "what does it mean?", don't you?
            I'll give you some examples.
        </p>

        <h2> Philosophy </h2>
        <h3> Why Philosophy? </h3>
        <p> My answer is "Because, everything is consist of Egos".
